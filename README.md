# Push_swap

42 project, is a programming exercise that involves creating a C language program that sorts a stack of integers according to a specific set of rules. The objective is to sort the pile using as few moves as possible. The project evaluates both sorting logic and management of stack operations.

Here is a summary of the main components of the "push_swap" project:

  Objective: The main objective is to sort a stack of integers into a specific order using two stacks (A and B) and a limited set of operations.

  Constraints: The program must be efficient in terms of the number of moves to sort the stack. It is subject to strict constraints in terms of execution time and performance.

  Rules: Permitted operations include rotations, inversions and movement of elements between piles A and B. The precise rules may vary depending on specific project guidelines.

  Sorting Algorithm: Students are generally free to design their own sorting algorithm, but it must be optimized to minimize the total number of moves.

  Optimization: Program optimization is an essential aspect of the project. Students are encouraged to find efficient solutions and minimize the number of operations needed to sort the stack.

  Notation: Operations are often represented by letters, for example "sa" for swap on stack A, "pb" for push from stack A to stack B, etc.

We must use our programming, algorithmic and optimization skills to succeed in the “push_swap” project. This project aims to develop students' ability to design efficient algorithms while respecting specific constraints.
